<p>Welcome to my Blog, this is the journey of me learning coding at the moment I am learning HTML as you can probably guess by this badly
  laid out page that I am literally just getting started. But as I get better I will not update the quality of the content as I feel like
  this way its like we learned together. :grin:
  
  ---------------------------
  Now so far I have only really learned how to use the HTML,Title,Header,Body and as a stroke of luck the paragraph tags
  so I have a long way to go,I personally find it difficult to remember all of these as it is,I have 2 young kids that are constantly
  running around so sometimes its hard to concentrate 100%</p>
  
  
  <p>Anyway I am Tom 26 year old furniture removalist I have 2 kids Luca, 5 and Brooklyn, 2
  My Partner Jess is a saint honestly she puts up with me :cheeky: I can be an absolute nightmare sometimes.</p>
  
  Lets get learning together though and hopefully on the pages to come I will learn how to input comments section because I would love to hear from everyone that follows along because as we learn helping each other out will help us all learn faster and help us get a good grasp on this gigantic task that is learning to code.
